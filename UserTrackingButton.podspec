                   # UserTrackingButton

                   A replacement for `MKUserTrackingBarButtonItem` when you don't have toolbars or navigation bars.

                    `UserTrackingButton` is a button that works in conjunction with `MKMapView`. Unlike `MKUserTrackingBarButtonItem` it can be used even when you don't have toolbars or navigation bars.
 
                   ## Installation

                   #### Carthage

                   Add `github "mkko/UserTrackingButton" ~> 0.3.1` to you `Cartfile`. Follow the further instrcutions on [Carthage getting started][1] page.

                   *NB: There is a bug with `@IBDesignable` when using external frameworks that prevents the view from rendering wihtin Interface Builder. Further reading can be found [here][2].*

                   #### Cocoapods

                   Add `pod 'UserTrackingButton', '~> 0.3.1'` to you `Podfile` and run `pod install`.

                   ## Setup

                   To use UserTrackingButton from Interface Builder simply subclass a `UIView` component and set its class to `UserTrackingButton`. Connect the `mapView` outlet and you're done.

                   The same steps are required when adding the button in code:

                   ```
                   let btn = UserTrackingButton(frame: trackingButtonFrame)
                   btn.mapView = self.mapView
                   self.view.addSubview(btn)
                   ```
                   And there, you're done. The button handles the binding to user tracking state of the `MKMapView` instance.
